        <p>"Hello, my name is Azhar, and I'm passionate about becoming a skilled programmer. <br> 
            While I'm relatively new to the field, my enthusiasm for coding and problem-solving <br>
            knows no bounds. I've been diving into various programming languages and technologies, <br>
            eager to learn and grow with each project I undertake.</p>
